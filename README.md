# Hugo Theme Cooler

Hugo Theme Cooler is a single column theme for hugo based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and a css styling from [Bootstrap Enhancement](http://behigh.github.io/bootstrap_dropdowns_enhancement/).

It is forked from [Hugo Theme Arch](https://github.com/syui/hugo-theme-arch). Currently, we maintain this theme for the official website of [SNLab Freedom Zone](https://github.com/snlab-freedom).

It is a simple template containing a nice header menu bar and content area.

## Get the source code

I assume you've Git installed. Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

```bash
$ hugo new site example.com
$ cd example.com
$ git clone https://github.com/snlab-freedom/hugo-theme-cooler themes/hugo-theme-cooler
$ cp -av themes/hugo-theme-cooler/exampleSite/* .
$ hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](//localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
